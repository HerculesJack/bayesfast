# BayesFast

BayesFast is a Python package for efficient Bayesian analysis
developed by [He Jia](http://hejia.io) and
[Uros Seljak](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/uros-seljak),
which can be orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods,
on both posterior sampling and evidence estimation.
